# Anomaly Detection with Autoencoder

This project demonstrates how to use an Autoencoder for anomaly detection. The Autoencoder is trained to reconstruct normal data, and samples with high reconstruction errors are classified as anomalies.

## Features
- Synthetic dataset with normal and anomalous data points.
- Autoencoder model with an encoder-decoder architecture.
- Calculation of reconstruction error for anomaly detection.
- Visualization of detected anomalies.
